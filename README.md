# VISUAL_SLAM
Implemented Visual SLAM for the case of Unmanned Ground Vehicles in indoor environments. RGB-D sensors (Microsoft Kinect), due to their low-cost and light weight are widely used in cluttered indoor environments. We show an application of our algorithm on the TUMâ€™s open-source RGB-D SLAM dataset.
